# Mapping Youth Protests in Africa

```
python map.py
```

Currently set on World Provinces shapefile, if you want to see the Country Admin Level 1 of Africa, change lines 10-11.

Ideally, we want to have the Africa folder scope, with World-Province level of specificity in mapping counties where there are counties in Africa.
